						<p class="prj2-text">The design of touch screen for washing machine totally excludes any mechanical button. For this reason, it was significant to create the right visual perception to start the action and following feedback. 
							<p class="prj2-text">The whole process of creation includes research, brainstorming, iterative sketches and amazing coffee made by my friends while I was designing :) 
							</p>
							<p class="prj2-text"> The review of trends and modern directions in washing machine helped to determine common functions and user groups. The current design is focused on wide range of user groups consisting from students, workers and house-people. These potential users can handle washing machine with four chosen standard programs: </p>
					<ul class="washingMachine">
				 		<li class="prj2-text"> Cotton - above 400 C, high spin </li>
				 		<li class="prj2-text"> Delicate - below 400 C, low spin </li>
				 		<li class="prj2-text"> Sport - low temperature, long wash cycles</li>
				 		<li class="prj2-text"> Quick - regulated time of washing process</li>
				 	</ul>
				 
				 	<p class="prj2-text">The default screen of washing machine shows upper tab from menu and four programs, and the the content of chosen program. Avoiding abundance and focusing on main actions were one of main priorities as I wanted to make laundry as simple as possible.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p class="prj2-text">Each program has certain time, temperature and spin regulations. The limitations in each program is made to avoid fabric damage by setting inappropriate parameters. The program can change such parameters as time, temperature and spin. Their view reminds buttons in common user interface so user can activate them by tapping the button. Activation shows what values user can change.</p>

					<p class="prj2-text">To change the value is possible by tapping button. Beside visual changes as brightness and numerical value, user also gets haptic feedback to feel the interaction. </p>
